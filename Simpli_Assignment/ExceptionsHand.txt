/*      -------------------         Exception Handling....
 *  > Achieve :
 *          1. try-catch block.. 
 *          2. throws Exception...
 *  1.  try- catch -finally :
 *          > try     : if we found in the particular section error could be occured..
 * 
 *          > catch   : whatever error caughts in try block it catch that and display error.
 * 
 *          > finally : The main use of finally block is to close the connections.
 *                  Even if you get an exception or not the LOC in the finally block gets executed.
 *                          -   To execute finally block we need min one try block
 *                          -   Without catch u can write a try block ..by using finally
 *  2.  throws Exception...
 *          > throws  : throw is used to define an exception statement..
 *                    use: throws is used to remove the exception in a method and throw it out 
 *                          of the program automatically.-UDE(user defined exception)
 * 
 *          >   Create UDE :
 *                      -   Create a UDE class and extend it to the “Exception” Class...
 *                      -   Create a constructor with the statement as the arg of the exception..
 *                      -   Pass the statement to the super constructor of the exception so as to 
 *                          link it to the super class Exception.
 * 
 *                  >   Exception statement is :
 *                                  throw new UDEname(“statement”);
